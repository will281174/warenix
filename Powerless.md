# Introduction #
The power button of my nexus one is broken, I cannot do reboot phone or lock screen tasks without the need of a adb shell. So I make a simple app to replace what a hardware button does.

# Features #
v1.0 (1 Apr 2012)
  * Reboot or reboot to recovery (root required)
  * lock screen (2.2+ required)
  * Tap notification to lock screen immediately
