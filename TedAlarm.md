# Introduction #

TedAlarm is an idea proposed by my friend Ted that he wants an alarm only rings on working days but not holidays. He inspired me to make an alarm app knows which day is a holiday.

# Features #

  * Single/ Repeating alarm. Choose the type of alarm you want.
  * Knows holidays. When there's an event happening from your chosen "holiday calendars", TedAlarm will not ring.
  * Wake you gently. TedAlarm increases the volume gently so you can wake up with a good mood.
  * Auto sync google calendars. TedAlarm will get events for the coming 7 days everyday automatically so you can set once and forget it. (the job starts at 00:00)

# How to use it #

  1. Sync Google Calendar to get your list of calendars and events coming in 7 days
  1. Type a description of the alarm.
  1. Set the alarm start time
  1. Choose calendars as reference holiday calendar
  1. Choose which week day you want the alarm to be repeated
  1. Done

# When will it ring #

Single shot alarm will always ring.

Repeating alarm will take your chosen google calendars into account to see if there is any event happing when the alarm is scheduled to ring. If so, the alarm will be skipped, otherwise it will wake you up.

# How to stop the ring #
You can press the **stop** button on screen or **back**/ **home** button on your device. Either way will stop ringing. If the alarm is a repeating one, it will be scheduled to ring on your chosen days. If not, it will be removed from schedule.

# Limitations #
  * Google Calendar is not automatically synchronized so you have to manually sync it.
  * Only the default alarm ringtone is played to wake you up.
  * No configurable options at the moment.
